We have created a simple game named climber.
Our goal was to make a climber move to the rectangles by pressing two button on the keyboard.

We put the rectangles on a mountain and if you press letter 'D' the climber will move to the right and of you will press letter 'A he will move to left.

If the climber reaches the last rectangle, then a victory will appear there.

The locations of the rectangles we made though css.
The working of the button we made with js.
